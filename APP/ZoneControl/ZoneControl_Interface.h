 *             - Temperature sensor (LM35)
 *             - Light sensor (LDR)
 *             - Relay
 *             - LED 
 *             - Fan
 *             This ensures that all components in every zone are properly set up 
 *             before operation.
 * 
 * @note    Must be called once at system startup before using any zone-related 
 *             operations.

/**
 * @fn         ZoneControl_Task
 * @brief      Executes periodic zone control operations.
 * @details    This function handles the main control logic for each zone. It performs:
 *             - Reading sensor data: Temperature (LM35) and Light status (LDR).
 *             - Controlling actuators based on mode:
 *                - **Automatic Mode**:
 *                   - Controls lighting (Relay + LED) depending on light conditions (Morning/Evening).
 *                   - Adjusts fan speed proportionally to temperature.
 *                - **Manual Mode**:
 *                   - Processes incoming communication commands for actuators (LED, Fan).
 *             - Sends updated zone data (sensors + actuator status) via Communication module.
 * 
 * @note       This function shall be called periodically in the superloop
 *             to ensure continuous monitoring and control of all zones.
 *
 * @note       Adding new zones only requires updating **ZoneConfig.h**. No logic 
 *             changes are needed in ZoneControl.
 * 
 * @warning    ZoneControl_Init() must be called before using this function to ensure
 *             that all sensors and actuators are properly initialized.

* DC Motor (Fan)                   → PD7 (OC2)   PWM
* Led (Light)                      → PC6
* Relay (Light)                    → PC7

## System Workflow

The system continuously reads sensor data (LDR & LM35) from four environmental zones.

Each zone includes a fan and a light that can be controlled automatically or manually.

🔹 Auto Mode:

The system automatically controls the actuators based on sensor readings:

Lighting: Turns ON when the LDR detects low light (evening) and OFF when brightness increases (morning).

Fan: Adjusts its speed based on temperature thresholds from the LM35 sensor (e.g., higher temperature → higher fan speed).

Decisions are made independently for each zone according to predefined thresholds.

🔹 Manual Mode:

The user controls lights and fans in each zone via Bluetooth (HC-05) commands.

The command format is:

Z <zone_id> <actuator> = <value>


Example: Z2FAN=20 → sets fan speed to 20 in Zone 2
Example: Z3LIGHT=ON  → turns ON light in Zone 3
